## ðŸ“‘Project Overview

**This Version** is mine if you want to see the real version you can check the original repo **[equipo4-ed4-backend](https://github.com/lemcok/equipo4-ed4-backend/tree/main)**

LugarAccesibleAPI is focused on accessibility in terms of wheelchair availability, allowing people with reduced mobility to obtain information about wheelchair-accessible spaces based on their location. This API-based service provides detailed information on wheelchair-accessible spaces, including accessibility features, layout details, and entrance information. Additionally, users can leave comments and reviews, sharing their experiences and feedback to help others in the community make informed decisions.
